    At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The women sat in a row. They all wore different colors and
    <character [(value)]="names[0]"></character>
    wore a jaunty
    <color [(value)]="colors[0]"></color>
    hat.
    <character [(value)]="names[1]"></character>
    was at the far left, next to the guest wearing a
    <color></color>
    jacket. The lady in
    <color></color>
    sat left of someone in
    <color></color>
    . I remember that
    <color></color>
    outfit because the woman spilled her
    <drink></drink>
    all over it. The traveler from
    <city></city>
    was dressed entirely in
    <color></color>
    . When one of the dinner guests bragged about her
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[2]"></heirloom>
    , the woman next to her said they were finer in
    <city></city>
    , where she lived.
  </p>
  <p>
    So
    <character [(value)]="names[3]"></character>
    showed off a prized
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[3]"></heirloom>
    , at which the lady from
    <city [(value)]="cities[0]"></city>
    scoffed, saying it was no match for her
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[0]"></heirloom>
    . Someone else carried a valuable
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[1]"></heirloom>
    and when she saw it, the visitor from
    <city></city>
    next to her almost spilled her neighbor's
    <drink></drink>
    .
    <character [(value)]="names[2]"></character>
    raised her
    <drink [(value)]="drinks[2]"></drink>
    in toast. The lady from
    <city></city>
    , full of
    <drink></drink>
    , jumped up onto the table falling onto the guest in the center seat, spilling the poor woman's
    <drink></drink>
    . Then
    <character [(value)]="names[4]"></character>
    captivated them all with a story about her wild youth in
    <city [(value)]="cities[4]"></city>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    In the morning there were four heirlooms under the table:
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[2]"></heirloom>
    ,
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[4]"></heirloom>
    ,
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[0]"></heirloom>
    , and
    <heirloom [(value)]="heirlooms[1]"></heirloom>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    But who owned each?
